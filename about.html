        <p>Imani would describe herself as faithful. Her life purpose shadows the bible verse 2 Corinthian 5:7 "We walk by faith and not by sight"
        She was taught this verse in bible study as a child and has made it her life-long motto. Her name means 'faith' in Swahili. She likes to
        think that God gave her this name as a reminder of who she is; a faithful believer. Imani is a 20 year old student studying Communications
        at Old Dominion University. She is inpired by poetry and music and loves to capture
        the deep messages hidden in art. She is an up and coming photographer and blogger. Her faith in God keeps her determined and strong-willed.
        She knows she will succeed in life and she dares anyone to tell her otherwise.

 <p>"Therefore, being always of good courage, and knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord--for we walk by faith,
 not by sight--we are of good courage, I say, and prefer rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord."<br>
